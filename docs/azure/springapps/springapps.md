# SpringApps:

# Own stuff:
 - Short introduction with links etc.:
   - https://github.com/wkaczurba/AzureForJava/blob/master/README.md - repo with links.

Full tutorial:
 - `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/deploy-run-java-applications-azure-spring-apps/` - look into this one!, seems legit.

- `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ie/training/paths/get-started-java-azure/` - also seems legit.



Seems like a short one:
 - `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-spring-cloud-workshop/` [I did it but something fails./!]
   - it worked the second time!

- `https://github.com/microsoft/azure-spring-apps-training` - look into this one again.!

1. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/deploy-run-java-applications-azure-spring-apps/?source=recommendations
